# tfprojects
Here are some small projects/assignments I have done with Tensorflow, Keras, and SciKit-Learn.

I learned much from DeepLizard (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4UJ26WkceqONNF5S26OiVw) and many other sources. So, check them out for a better understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
